In this code,we have created solidity contract.
Step1-The pragma directive pragma solidity >=0.6.12 <0.9.0; sets the Solidity compiler version range for this contract.
It ensures compatibility with Solidity versions greater than or equal to 0.6.12 and less than 0.9.0.

Step 2-Contract Declaration:We declare a contract named MyToken.

Step 3-Public Variables:
token_name: This variable stores the name of our token. It's a string initialized to "Sandeep".
token_abbrv: This variable stores the abbreviation of our token. It's a string initialized to "SNDP".
total_supply: This variable stores the total supply of our token. It's an unsigned integer initialized to 0.

Step 4-Mapping:balances: This mapping associates addresses with token balances. It maps addresses to unsigned 
integers representing token balances.

Step 5-Mint Function (mint):This function is responsible for minting new tokens.
Parameters:address _address: Represents the address to which tokens will be minted.
uint _value: Represents the number of tokens to mint.
Functionality:Increases the total supply by _value.
Increases the balance of _address by _value.

Step 6-Burn Function (burn):This function is responsible for burning (destroying) tokens.
Parameters:address _address: Represents the address from which tokens will be burned.
uint _value: Represents the number of tokens to burn.
Functionality:Checks if the balance of _address is greater than or equal to _value.
If the balance is sufficient, it deducts _value from both the total supply and the balance of _address.

In conclusion, we've dissected a Solidity smart contract that demonstrates minting and burning functionalities for a token.
